            <h3>Plot</h3>
           <article>
            <p>Late one night, the civilian airship Saturn travels swiftly through the clouds. Amongst the passengers aboard are Sheeta, the owner of a strange blue stone necklace, and Colonel Muska, the government's secret agent who has abducted her and seized her necklace. Without warning, a squadron of air pirates, led by Dola, attack the airship in search of Sheeta and her necklace. During the ensuing chaos caused by the intrusion, Sheeta manages to knock Muska unconscious and retrieve her necklace. The pirates then break into her room; she attempts to hide by climbing outside and clinging to the exterior of the aircraft. However, she loses her grip and plummets into the dark sky below.</p>
            <p>As the unconscious Sheeta hurtles toward the ground, the stone on her necklace emits a mysterious light, slowing her descent significantly. From the small mining town of Slag Ravine, which just so happens to be directly underneath her, a young orphan miner named Pazu sees a distant light falling from the sky. He runs toward the light to investigate, only to find that its source is indeed the stone that Sheeta is still wearing, whom Pazu reaches out to catch. To his amazement, she feels weightless until her stone deactivates. Pazu tries to tell his boss, Mr. Duffi, of her sudden appearance, but is unable to amidst the bustle of the mining work. The miners have had no luck lately finding any coal or tin and have to start over as all the mines to the east have nothing either. Once the mine is shut down for the night, he carries Sheeta back to his house.</p>
            <p>The next morning, Sheeta awakens to the sound of Pazu playing his trumpet on the roof. After introducing each other, Pazu asks to see her stone. Believing that her necklace is the reason for her surviving the fall, he tries to levitate himself with it, only to crash through the roof of the old blast furnace that his house is built with. After making sure he is unhurt from the mishap, Sheeta notices a photograph of Laputa, otherwise believed to be a mere legend, on a wall in his home. Pazu explains that it was taken by his father, who was a fervid aviator, and how he saw the island during a trip aboard an airship, where it was embedded within an intense thunderstorm. After the excursion, his father returned and disclosed his observations of the island, but no one believed his discovery. He then died in misery and embarrassment, having been labeled a liar. Pazu concludes the story with his plans to finish a huge ornithopter so that he can travel to Laputa and confirm his father's sighting.</p>
            <p>At that moment, however, the air pirates relocate Sheeta after having tracked her down since her falling from Saturn. Pazu disguises her as a male miner and, after narrowly avoiding a confrontation with Louis, leads her into town to find help. Meanwhile, Henri and Charles are in the middle of asking Mr. Duffi about Sheeta. They then spot the two unwittingly approach from down the street; Sheeta inadvertently stumbles and loses her hat, revealing her true identity. Just as Mr. Duffi and Pazu prepare to defend Sheeta from the pirates, Okami, Mr. Duffi's wife, pulls the pair of children into their house before instructing them to escape through their backyard.</p>
            <p>A street fight ignites between the townspeople and pirates while Pazu and Sheeta sneak away to a nearby railway line, boarding a mine train powered by a small steam tram. Dola and her henchmen, having escaped the skirmish, notice Sheeta on the train and give chase. Meanwhile, one of Muska's spies spots Sheeta upon furtively watching the unfolding situation. Despite initially fending off the pirates, the children find themselves directly against a heavily armored battle train being commanded by the military. Realizing that Muska's agents are gaining reconnaissance on them, Sheeta orders Pazu to split up before fleeing, but Pazu defies her and follows her regardless. The pair are forced off the train and over a cliff. Just as death seems inevitable, Sheeta's stone activates once again, leaving both the pirates and military troops awestruck as they watch the two float gently downward.</p>

            <h3>Story</h3>
            <article>
            <p>The Kingdom of Laputariches, or "Laputa", was built when a great technological civilization over 700 years ago (the one in the story's present-time is the second, as depicted by the film's opening) thrived, by a people who fled to the sky out of hatred for the wars of the Earth.</p>
            <p>In this time, Laputa was a pinnacle of the civilization's technology, dominating the skies in a hegemony of other aerial kingdoms. Unlike these other kingdoms, which relied on rotors, Laputa maintained its airborne state by way of the element Aetherium. For a time, the kingdom prospered. However, after the civilization reached too high an altitude, the Laputians lost their vitality, and the population gradually declined, until they died out as a result of a strange disease that broke out abruptly around 500 BCE. The ancient Greek philosopher Plato is said to have made note of this history in his lost geography On the Heavens, the minimal surviving knowledge of which inspired the Laputa of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels.</p>
            <p>Legend has it that some of the Laputians, including the royal family and some of their subjects, abandoned the city at this time, hid themselves and lived on, but the details of this are unclear. Laputa was deserted, left only to the care of robots that waited for the return of their king. Over the years, the territory crumbled, and now only part of it wanders through the sky; moving with the westerlies as a constant low-pressure system that hides it entirely from view from the ground.[2]

                There is a theory in modern times that there existed an ancient culture that selfishly indulged in nuclear energy and wrought untold destruction, espoused by a few people. This is based on the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, and the number of believers in this theory is particularly great in India</p>
